# Geo-Compliance Automation System

A comprehensive solution for automating geo-specific regulatory compliance checks using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This system addresses TikTok's challenge of proactively implementing legal guardrails before feature launches by turning regulatory detection from a blind spot into a traceable, auditable output.

## Problem Statement

As TikTok operates globally, every product feature must dynamically satisfy dozens of geographic regulations â€“ from Brazil's data localization laws to GDPR compliance. The challenge is to build a prototype system that utilizes LLM capabilities to flag features that require geo-specific compliance logic, empowering TikTok to:

1. **Proactively implement legal guardrails** before feature launch
2. **Generate auditable evidence** proving features were screened for regional compliance needs
3. **Confidently respond** to regulatory inquiries with automated traceability

Without automated compliance checking, potential risks include:

- Legal exposure from undetected compliance gaps
- Reactive firefighting when auditors or regulators inquire
- Manual overhead in scaling global feature rollouts

## Solution Overview

Our system transforms regulatory compliance from reactive manual processes to proactive automated governance. The platform leverages advanced AI techniques to analyze documents against an extensive database, providing immediate feedback on potential compliance conflicts through bidirectional analysis.

### Key Features

- **Bidirectional Document Analysis**: Upload either law documents or feature documents for comprehensive compliance checking
- **Feature Impact Assessment**: When law documents are uploaded, identify existing features that may require modifications
- **Compliance Validation**: When feature documents are uploaded, flag potential conflicts with existing regulations
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed compliance reports with clear reasoning and evidence trails
- **Multi-Format Export**: Download reports as PDF, Excel, or view directly in the browser
- **Audit Trail Generation**: Maintain complete traceability for regulatory inquiries
- **Real-Time Processing**: Immediate analysis and feedback on uploaded documents

## Architecture

### System Flow
![alt text](<Document Processing with RAG Sequence-1.png>)
#### Feature Document Upload Flow

1. **Document Upload**: Users upload feature artifact documents through the web interface
2. **Backend Processing**: Documents are sent to the backend server for initial processing
3. **LLM Parsing**: Feature documents are parsed through Gemini LLM to extract structured information
4. **Embedding Generation**: Parsed content is converted to embeddings for similarity matching
5. **Law Database Query**: FAISS vector store is queried for law documents exceeding similarity threshold
6. **RAG Processing**: Retrieved law documents serve as context for LLM analysis
7. **Compliance Analysis**: LLM identifies potential law violations and compliance requirements for the new feature
8. **Data Storage**: Results are stored in MongoDB and feature is added to feature database
9. **Report Generation**: Frontend generates compliance reports showing regulatory conflicts

#### Law Document Upload Flow

1. **Document Upload**: Users upload law or regulation documents through the web interface
2. **Backend Processing**: Law documents are sent to the backend server for processing
3. **LLM Parsing**: Law documents are parsed through Gemini LLM to extract regulatory requirements
4. **Embedding Generation**: Parsed legal content is converted to embeddings
5. **Feature Database Query**: FAISS vector store is queried for existing features that may be affected
6. **RAG Processing**: Retrieved feature documents serve as context for impact analysis
7. **Impact Analysis**: LLM identifies existing features that may need modification due to the new regulation
8. **Data Storage**: Law is added to the law database and analysis results stored in MongoDB
9. **Report Generation**: Frontend generates impact assessment reports showing affected features
